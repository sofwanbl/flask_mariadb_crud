# flask_mariadb_crud
This is a simple Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) application using Flask and MariaDB. 
This application has 3 input, 2 values and 1 operator. It gives result and remark.
You should run virtual environment and install Flask first before running this application.

To run this application, you need to have Python and Flask. In addition you also need have some extensions, they are : flask_wtf and Flask-wtf version 1.5.2 or the Latest version (On my experiment, the latest version when I try was not working yet, I don't know the reason)
